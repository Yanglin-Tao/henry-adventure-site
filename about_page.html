    What can technologies do and how they can affect us? The fictional relationship between the character and the hypothetic knowledge
    glasses tells a vivid story of the ethical challenges we might face when dealing with a piece of noble technology. <br>
    <br>
    Our story is in the form of design fiction, which “incorporates speculative fiction and prototyping,
    juxtaposing materials and narrative to visualize and start conversations about a particular scenario (Bleecker, 2009).
    We use it not to imagine a future technology necessarily but, drawing on Langdon Winner (1986), to imagine
    forms of life that might materialize.” <br>

    1. Utilitarianism and Duty <br>
    O'Neill, Onora "A Simplified Account of Kant's Ethics," in Gendler-Siegel-Cahn, The
    Elements of Philosophy (2008), New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 112-114 <br>
    Kant’s ethics highlights the rule of conduct that is unconditional or absolute for all agents,
    the validity or claim of which does not depend on any desire or end. Henry cheats to pass the test to earn
    a doctor’s degree, which violates the universal moral law. Kant’s ethics suggests that it’s immoral for Henry
    to use the knowledge glasses anymore, not even to save the child from the disease. However, from a utilitarian
    point of view, saving the child shows benevolence and produces the greatest good. Moreover, if Henry is the
    only person who has the all-knowing power to save the child, then this would likely be his moral duty to help.
    Utilitarians think the end justifies the means because it’s morally good for Henry to use the machine and save
    the child. The decisions based on Kant’s ethics or utilitarianism is one of the main ethical tensions in the
    storyline.

    2. Ethics and Digital Labor <br>
    Flash Forward, “Boss Bot,” September 29, 2020: https://www.flashforwardpod.com/2020/09/29/boss-bot/ <br>
    A similar comparison is drawn between the Boss Bot and the hypothetical knowledge glasses as both utilize an
    on-demand mechanism to access information. The Boss Bot uses algorithms to match people to jobs based on
    certain personality metrics, while the knowledge glasses grant people access to any knowledge to their wish
    to learn. Though both technologies provide benefits like guaranteeing a job or accessing any information, the
    underlying problem is that they oversimplify the procedures that are supposed to be more human-involved. In an
    actual learning process, one needs to practice and reason about the knowledge. These procedures are often not
    considered as robust and systematic as digital labor, but they are essential to creating values as human beings.
