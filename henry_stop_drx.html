    Henry soon found Dr. X. When Dr. X explained the situation to Henry, Henry stood dumbfounded, not realizing that
    the cause of everything was actually the small glowing object in the grass decades ago.
    When Henry regained his senses, he soon realized that sharing knowledge fairly to all would bring endless trouble,
    war, politics, and even genocide. So he tried every means to persuade Dr. X.
    <br>
    <br>
    With Henry's persuasion, Dr. X was enlightened and immediately aborted the replication program before it was too late.
    In fact, Dr. X expected the possible outcome at the very beginning, so he only sent the replica to Henry to test the
    reaction.
    <br>
    <br>
    With Henry's help, things didn't go in a terrible direction.
