<p class = "intro_body">''Ah... This damn week is finally over'' said Henry. Henry was hungry and tired,
    so he decided to go eat his favorite grape fried beef. (Yes! He loved it!)
    Just as Henry was sitting on the side of the road eating a wonderful meal,
    he spotted a mysterious, shiny object in the grass. It was a pair of glasses,
    and curiously, it came with a manual. <br>
    <br>
    Henry played with the glasses, and then he curiously put them on.

<details class = "manual">
    <summary>Expand and see what the manual says!</summary>
    <p> Product Name: Knowledge Glasses.<br>
        <br>
        Functionality: It looks like a common pair of glasses.
        However, when wearing the Knowledge Glasses, the user can select a field of knowledge
        and learn it immediately in a short time.
        Besides, the knowledge obtained from the glasses can only stay in the user's brain
        for a certain period of time, and the user needs to wear the glasses continuously to ensure the existence of the knowledge.
        <br>
        <br>
        Operation details: The Knowledge Glasses is able to scan the nerves in the user's retina and
        give feedback to the user's brain (hippocampus) through the nerves. Therefore, the user
        can receive information in a nanosecond. At the same time, since the nerves of the human hippocampus
        have a memory recovery, the neural fluctuations obtained from the glasses will be
        rejected by the user's brain after a period of time and the acquired knowledge will be released (or deleted).
        <br>
        <br>
        Side effects: All the knowledge in the glasses will be 'temporary' to the user. <br>
