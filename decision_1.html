<p class = "intro">After a torturous exam week, Henry walked as usual <br>
    to the food truck he had been pratronizing. While sitting on the sidelines, <br>
    he spotted a mysterious, shiny object in the grass. It was a pair of glasses, <br>
    and curiously, it came with a manual. </p>
<details class = "manual">
    <summary>Expand and see what the manual says!</summary>
    <p>Listen up! <br>
        This is a pair of knowledge glasses that allows you <br>
        to learn any piece of knowledge you wish to learn. <br>
        But remember, the effect of the glasses is only temporary. <br>
        After a short amount of time, you'll remember nothing! <br>
        â€”â€”â€”â€” anonymous scientist from Earth 606
