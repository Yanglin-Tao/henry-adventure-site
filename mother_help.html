    With the help of glasses, Henry became a successful neuroscientist and earned some money. <br>
    <br>
    One day Henry was watching daily news on TV, where
    he saw a mother seeking help for her little child. Her child seemed to have a very critical condition and many
    renowned doctors could not do much about it. In the end, the mother mentioned
    Henry as her "last hope."

    <p>
        The small child has been suffering so much and she will die if no one's to help.
        And Iâ€™m able to do the best a doctor can do. Moreover, helping people brings me happiness. Plus, saving a dying child
        is cool, isn't it?<br>
        <br>
        However, this is not my business after all. I have never treated this disease before and what if even the
        knowledge glasses cannot help her? I'll be so embarrassed if I failed. What
        will other people think of me? Will I lose my reputation afterwards?
