<p class = "intro_body"> One day Henry was watching daily news on TV, where
    he saw a mother seeking help for her little child. Her child seems to have a very critical condition and many
    renowned doctors she requested help cannot do much about it. At the end of the show, the mother mentioned
    Henry as her "last hope."

    <p>I really donâ€™t want to see the child suffering this crucial disease!
        The small child has been lucky since he come to me for help!
        And Iâ€™m able to do the best a doctor can do. Now finally itâ€™s time to justify my original intention
        to study neuroscience, though itâ€™s so tedious at school, helping people truly bring me happiness. <br>
        <br>
        However, with the glasses help the competition is unfair for other peopleâ€¦
        but as long as I can help people with it, fairness is less important.
        Sadly, I also have to admit it is the glasses that arm me with this confidence but not my own ability.
        Not only the child, Iâ€™m also being lucky.
