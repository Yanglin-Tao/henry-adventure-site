    Henry is proud of himself but also has a some guilty inside because without the glasses,
    his ability and knowledge level does not match the requirements of the doctor degree.
    He thought to himself that if without the glasses, hard working can also bring him success.
    <br>
    <br>
    However, looking back, he found himself spent much more time relaxing and entertaining himself and left school work to the glasses.
    It has been with him for years and no one else seem to know what the knowledge glasses is all about.
    As far as he knew, thereâ€™s no side effect of the knowledge glasses.
    so he let down his guard.
