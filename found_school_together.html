    Determined to use this knowledge properly, Henry and Dr. X joined NYU as full professors at the beginning of the
    fall of 2034, and because they were teaching something that had never been done before, the university created an
    entirely new department for him. Department of Future Technologies and Knowledge.
    <br>
    <br>
    With the arrival of Henry and Dr. X, and a flurry of academic gurus, NYU Tandon replaced MLT as one of the nation's
    leading top engineering schools. A few years later, they led a brand new faculty team to establish NYU's 19th school,
    funding 70% of their total assets and naming it: The Henry and Xander School of Future Resources.
    <br>
    <br>
    When both Henry and Dr.X got old, they started to consider whether it is a good idea to keep the glasses on earth or
    try other ways.
