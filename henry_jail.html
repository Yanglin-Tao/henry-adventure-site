    In the end, Henry lost his trial, forfeited all his belongings,
    and was sentenced to three years in prison.
    It was the first time in decades that Henry left the glasses, and he began to
    become irritable and unfriendly in prison, everyone now try to walk away from him. <br>
    <br>
    Henry had counted on his little glasses way too much in past years,
    and when "knowledge, fame, honors" all left him, his heart could no longer bear the ordinary.
    After the first few months, Henry lost his mind and became a soulless walking corpse.
