<p class = "intro_body">The morning after,
    Henry woke up and habitually reached for his glasses, but instantly a cold sweat broke out on his forehead:
    he canâ€™t find his glasses!!!
    Then he repeatedly looked around the room until he found his bedroom window had been pried open.

    <summary>Henry is very conflicted at this point, click and see what he's thinking</summary>
    <p> I donâ€™t know how to do and what gonna happen...
        If I asked the police to find my glasses, my whole secret would likely come out.
        Ultimately, I would be investigated for academic integrity issues and could result in his degree being revoked.
        In that case, I would lose everything I had achieved so far and could be put in jail.  <br>
