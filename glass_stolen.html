    Henry woke up and habitually reached for his glasses, but instantly a cold sweat broke out on his forehead:
    he canâ€™t find his glasses!!!
    Then he looked around the room until he found his bedroom window had been pried open.

    <summary>Henry is very conflicted at this point, click and see what he's thinking</summary>
    <p> That's crazy! I have no idea what's gonna happen.
        If I asked the police to find my glasses, my secrets of the glasses would likely to be revealed.
        In that case, I might lose everything I had achieved.  <br>
