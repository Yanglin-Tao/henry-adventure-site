    Feeling confused, Henry used the knowledge of the glasses to seek answer in the multiverse.
    A man appeared at the other side of the world, who called himself "Mr. Master." Mr. Master was the founder of Future
    Technologies on Earth 606. He was also the creator of the knowledge glasses.
    <br>
    <br>
    Mr. Master learned about what happened in Henry's world and shook his head. He then told Henry that the only way
    he could save human was to destroy all the glasses at the same time. The knowledge to destroy all the glasses on
    the world, curiously, was the knowledge the glasses could provide.
