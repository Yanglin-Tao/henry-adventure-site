    One day, Henry visited hospital and saw a sick child suffering from brain condition.
    The child was in high pressure and had
    difficulty speaking. The mother told Henry that her son woke up scared every night and suffered mentally and physically.
    The family tried to buy medicine to make him feel better, but it was too expensive.
    <br>
    <br>
    No matter how sick the boy is, his mother wanted him to be around. In the end, the mother cried besides the child's bed.
