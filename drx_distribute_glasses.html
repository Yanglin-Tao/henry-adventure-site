  Through the glasses, Xander realized that he could easily access all human knowledge, regardless of any language,
  any subject. At this moment he realized a very serious problem, a small pair of glasses in front of him may be the key
  to helping all mankind out of the bottleneck of education and knowledge, the key that truly can evolve mankind to a whole
  new dimension.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xander soon became a respected doctor through the knowledge in glasses and became admired and respected by many who
  were engaged in education. However, what he was planning in his head was something even crazier. He wanted to use the
  knowledge he gained from the glasses to replicate the glasses in order to achieve the ideal society he had in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr. X has always been a seeker of social justice, enable everyone with the same ability is the only absolutely fair
  in his belief. In the days that followed, Dr. X tried to distribute copies of the glasses to every person on Earth,
  but this caused a catastrophe later on...
