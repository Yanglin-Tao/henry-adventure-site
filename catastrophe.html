    At the beginning, everyone is satisfied with these glasses because
    they enabled people to access a large range of knowledge that will definitely take a lifetime to learn.
    No books, no homework, no exams. <br>
    <br>
    People stopped working in labs because "researches" become cheap and easy. With time, people relied on knowledge glasses so much that many
    even forgot how to solve the simplest problems. Moreover, no creations were made during the first five-year period. The
    current system even begin to collapse since knowledge has been "abused."
