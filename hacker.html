    In fact, the glasses is now in the hands of "Dr. X," who used to be Henry's classmate at NYU.
    Dr. X paid $2,000,000 to hire the most talented thief in town to steal that pair of â€œplastic glassesâ€œ from Henry.
    <br>
    <br>
    After returning home and studying the glasses, Dr. X realized that his suspicions had been correct all along,
    and that Henry's knowledge did not belong to him. <br>
    <br>
    Through the glasses, Dr. X realized that he could easily access all human knowledge,
    regardless of any language, any subject. At this moment he realized a very serious problem,
    a small pair of glasses in front of him may be the key to helping all mankind out of the
    bottleneck of education and knowledge, the key that truly can evolve mankind to a whole new dimension.
