    Henry decided to give the glasses to the college and were placed in the middle of the hall of the Henry School
    f Future Resources, where hundreds of the world's best students and teachers walk past it every day,
    a place where people truly can see the flow of knowledgeâ€¦ <br>
    <br>
    Shortly after Henry presented the glasses, he passed away peacefully in honor and respect. <br>
    <br>
    At midnight after Henry's death, the security guard at the door was preparing to check the equipment and close the
    door as usual. All of a sudden, the glasses suddenly emitted an intense white light like 30 years ago... <br>
