  But Henry's knowledge all comes from the temporary knowledge instilled by the glasses.
  This led to his inability to restore a complete derivation process.
  He was required to meet with his mentors in the lab by their wills and was
  repeatedly found wrong by them while trying to prove it. <br>
  <br>
  The mentors all decided to appeal to the court and withdrew Henry's doctoral degree
  because they found that Henry could not even recall the details of his project when he was working on his PhD. <br>

  lose everything he achieved so far.
