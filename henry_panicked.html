<p class = "intro">But Henry's knowledge all comes from a moment of knowledge instilled by the glasses (knowledge glasses are not as powerful as he thought).
  This led to his inability to restore a complete derivation process. He met with his mentors in the lab and was repeatedly found wrong by them while trying to prove it.
  The mentors all decided to appeal to the academic court and withdrew Henry's doctoral degree because they found that Henry could not even recall the details of his project when he was working on his PhD.
  Henry was so panicked that he agreed to go to academic court to explain all this, or to continue to hide the existence of the knowledge glasses.
