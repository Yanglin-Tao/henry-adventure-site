    <summary>Click and view Henry's confession</summary>
    <p> Henry took off his glasses and bowed deeply to everyone present, explaining that the glasses
        he was holding were knowledge glasses from an unknown multiverse. And admitted that all the
        research he had done before was based on the glasses. Although this allowed him to realize his
        previous dream, it also made him feel guilty. He assured the judge that he had never done anything
        bad with the glasses before, and that despite his initial selfishness. <br>
