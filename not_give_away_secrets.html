<p class = "intro_body"> At this point, Henry decides not to give away his secrets
    because he knew that once the police intervened, they find out the specialities of the glasses.
    Although he has promised the mother to save her child, it's not worth it to risk his life and career.
    Henry made an excuse in the public so he could pull himself out of the trouble. <br>
    <br>
    However, the problem clearly won't solve itself. Simply ignore and doing nothing about the stolen glasses actually
    made things worse.
