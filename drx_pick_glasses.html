<p class = "intro_body"> All this was seen by Henry's best friend Xander across the road,
    he saw Henry walking towards the grass paused for a moment and then suddenly hurried away, which made him feel
    very strange so he crossed the road and walked to the light.
    <br>
    <br>
    He looked at the glowing object in the grass and was ready to pick it up straight away.
    Xander found that it was a seemingly ordinary pair of glasses, and put it on him without any further thinking.
