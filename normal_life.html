    At the end of the day, Henry saved the world by destroying all the knowledge glasses. But no one knew how the glasses
    disappeared, neither did they know Henry. Henry continued to live a normal life and nothing drastic happened. He
    worked in a small clinic and earned a moderate salary. But he was happy and satisfied
    because this was the life he deserved.
