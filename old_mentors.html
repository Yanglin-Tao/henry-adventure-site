<p class = "intro">Summary: Turns out, the mentors who issued Henry his PhD degree before heard the news and were very interested in his new research.
    But when studying Henry's project outcomes, they found something unusual there.
    They knew that Henry's level could not have broken through so fast and the level of knowledge is far beyond the current level of human technology.
    So they wanted Henry to provide evidence and proofs of his researches.
