    But how could this happen? It makes no sense to Henry since no one caught him cheating when he took the exams. <br>
    <br>
    Turns out, the previous mentors who gave Henry his PhD degree were very interested in his innovative
    treatment on the child.
    But when studying Henry's previous projects, they found something abnormal there. <br>

    They knew that Henry's academic level could not have broken through so fast and that
    knowledge was far beyond the current achievements of human technology.
