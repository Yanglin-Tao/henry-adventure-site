    After retirement, Henry lay alone in his penthouse on the 89th floor of Fifth Avenue overlooking the entire New
    York skyline, reflecting on how his life had been so dramatic ....
    <br>
    <br>
    "Ah, it's all because of you, my glasses," Henry said as he leaned against the window and fiddled with the glasses,
    "where you come from and where you should belong..." <br>
    <br>
    Henry looks back on the 19th NYU college he built and the laughter he had during his tenure.
    He wants to leave something behind for the students, he wants to be remembered in the future,
    and he wants to give more meaning to the school... <br>
    <br>
    "Should I donate the glasses to the school, permanently seal him and make him a symbol of the future?"
