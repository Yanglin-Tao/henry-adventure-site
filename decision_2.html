<p class = "intro_body"> Henry will have a biomolecular engineering midterm next week. But given that he now owned a pair of
    glasses that could give him any knowledge he needed,
    he realized that it's possible to get an A without even studying.

<details class = "exam">
    <summary>Click and see what Henry is thinking</summary>
    <p> If I use the glasses, I can pass the exams and get good grades easily.
        And finally, getting the degree would just be a piece of cake and I'll be much closer to become a
        renowned neuroscientist. <br>
        <br>
        So why not use it? At least try it in this upcoming biomolecular engineering midterm first.
        It won't be a big deal. <br>
        <br>
        But of course, it won't be a fair game to other students and will harm my academic integrity. What should I do?
