    Henry attended NYU's commencement ceremony on May 18, 2033
    and received Honorary Doctorate from NYU. As Henry was speaking passionately on stage,
    it occurred to him why not return to campus as a professor and pass on this advanced knowledge to students? <br>
    <br>
    Henry joined NYU as a full-time professor at the beginning of Fall 2034,
    and because he was teaching something unprecedented, the university establish a whole new department for him:
    The Department of Future Tech and Knowledge. <br>
    <br>
    With Henry's arrival, and with masters of academia flocking to the school,
    NYU Tandon replaces MLT to become one of the leading top engineering schools in the nation.
    A few years later, Henry led a brand new faculty team to establish the NYU's 19th school,
    fund 70% of his total assets, and name it: Henry School of Future Resources.
